# 📧 Spam Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and scikit-learn, the model processes and analyzes text data to accurately identify unwanted messages.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled SMS messages. Each entry includes:

- **Label**: Indicates whether the message is 'spam' or 'ham'.
- **Message**: The content of the SMS message.

*Note*: The dataset is loaded from a local CSV file. Ensure that the path to your dataset is correctly specified in the script.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert all text to lowercase.
   - Remove punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters.
   - Eliminate stopwords using NLTK’s stopword corpus.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transform text into numerical features using `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a classifier (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes).
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranat1729/Spam-Classifier.git
   cd Spam-Classifier
## 📈 Results

The model was evaluated using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to find all relevant (positive) cases.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall — balances false positives and false negatives.

Performance can vary depending on dataset balance, preprocessing, and the selected algorithm.
## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune parameters.
- **Model Comparison**: Try other classifiers like XGBoost, LightGBM, or deep learning models.
- **Web Interface**: Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions.
- **Improved Preprocessing**: Explore stemming, lemmatization, or word embeddings.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Integrate more diverse datasets to improve generalization and robustness.
